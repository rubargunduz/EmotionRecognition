Stress Score (S)

A weighted sum based on the emotional states associated with stress:

S = w1 × P_Angry + w2 × P_Fear + w3 × P_Sad + w4 × P_Disgust − w5 × P_Happy

where:
- P_X represents the probability (distribution percentage) of emotion X.
- Weights (w) determine the importance of each emotion. Typical values:
  - w1 = 1.0 (Angry)
  - w2 = 0.8 (Fear)
  - w3 = 0.7 (Sad)
  - w4 = 0.6 (Disgust)
  - w5 = 0.5 (Happy, subtracting because happiness reduces stress)

Tiredness Score (T)

A similar approach for tiredness:

T = v1 × P_Sad + v2 × P_Neutral − v3 × P_Happy − v4 × P_Surprise

where:
- v1 = 1.0 (Sad)
- v2 = 0.8 (Neutral)
- v3 = 0.6 (Happy, subtracted)
- v4 = 0.5 (Surprise, subtracted)
